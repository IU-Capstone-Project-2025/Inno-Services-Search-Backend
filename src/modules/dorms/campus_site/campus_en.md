## ABOUT US

The campus of Innopolis University is located in the youngest and most innovative city of the country — Innopolis. This is the first Russian city for IT specialists located 40 km from Kazan.

The buildings of the residential campus are equipped according to the "Accessible Environment" program. They have rooms for people with limited mobility, wide elevators, and the entrance group is equipped with a ramp. There are canteens and coffee shops on the territory of residential buildings and the University.

In Innopolis you will be able to see amazing sunsets and enjoy nature. And also — to visit local attractions: the island-city of Sviyazhsk, the Raif monastery. Or go skiing in the Sviyazhsky Hills complex in winter, and in summer — play golf and do bench shooting.

The seven buildings of the residential campus are connected by a pedestrian gallery, which flows smoothly into the University.

#####

The campus is home to students from different parts of Russia and other countries of the world. Seven buildings of the residential campus are designed for 2,095 places for accommodation.

## COMFORTABLE SPACE FOR STUDENTS

The design of the campus buildings was developed by a group of architects from Singapore. All 7 buildings are connected by a corridor that flows smoothly into the University. Thanks to the covered warm passage, it is convenient to move around the territory in any weather.


Comfortable living conditions have been created in the residential campus of the University so that everyday problems do not distract the student from studying.
