## About the Project

This API powers the search functionality within the **InNoHassle** ecosystem â€” a unified digital platform designed to simplify daily life for students of Innopolis University.
- Services code: [GitHub - one-zero-eight](https://github.com/one-zero-eight)
- Frontend: [GitHub - website](https://github.com/one-zero-eight/website)
- API endpoints: [api.innohassle.ru](https://api.innohassle.ru/)
- InNoHassle website: [innohassle.ru](https://innohassle.ru/)

The search service acts as a smart assistant, helping users quickly find information across various Innopolis University services.
## Functionality

### Supported features:
- `search` - search by keywords. Provides answers in the form of cards linking to resource websites with the ability to preview.
- `ask` - search by queries in free form. Provides answers generated by LLM with links to resource data.
- `act` - dialogue with action-based assistant. Provides the ability to perform actions in other Innopolis services on behalf of the user.

### Resources used:
- [Campus life](http://campuslife.innopolis.ru/) - general knowledge about the university for quick adaptation
- [Eduwiki](https://eduwiki.innopolis.university) - reference book on the educational process
- [Hotel](https://hotel.innopolis.university/) - information about dormitories
- [Residents](https://sez-innopolis.ru/residents/) - list of resident companies in Innopolis
- [InNoHassle](https://innohassle.ru) - an ecosystem that collects the functionality of Innopolis services in one place or links to them

## Development

### Run with Docker

1. Set up project settings file (check [settings.schema.yaml](../InNoHassle-Search/settings.schema.yaml) for more info).
   ```bash
   cp settings.example.yaml settings.yaml
   ```
   Put your `openrouter_api_key` in `settings.yaml`.
2. Set up database settings for [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) container
      in `.env` file
      ```bash
      cp .env.example .env
      ```

1. Start all services:
   ```bash
   uv run python -m src.ml_service
   docker compose up
   ```

Now you can find API docs on http://localhost:8004/docs.

### Run locally

1. Install [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
3. Install project dependencies with uv:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```
4. Set up [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks:

   ```bash
   uv run pre-commit install --install-hooks -t pre-commit -t commit-msg
   ```
5. Check that your `settings.yaml` looks like:
   ```yaml
   $schema: "./settings.schema.yaml"
   api_settings:
      db_url: "mongodb://mongoadmin:secret@localhost:27017/db?authSource=admin"
   minio:
      access_key: "minioadmin"
      secret_key: "password"
   ```
6. Set up a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and [Minio](https://min.io/) instances.

    - Set up database settings for [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) container
      in `.env` file
      ```bash
      cp .env.example .env
      ```
    - Run the database instance:
      ```bash
      docker compose up -d db minio
      ```
    - Make sure to set up the actual database connection in `settings.yaml`.
7. Choose the way to run models: either use Infinity or local models.
   1. If you want to use local models, just not set `infinity_url` in `settings.yaml`
   2. If you want to use Infinity, set `infinity_url` in `settings.yaml` to the url of deployed Infinity engine.
      You can run Infinity engine locally:
      ```bash
      uv run --no-project --with "infinity_emb[all]" --with "transformers<4.49" infinity_emb v2 --model-id jinaai/jina-embeddings-v3 --model-id jinaai/jina-reranker-v2-base-multilingual
      ```
      Or use deployed Infinity engine provided by someone else.

8. Run ml client
   ```bash
   uv run python -m src.ml_service
   ```
9. Run the ASGI server
   ```bash
   uv run python -m src.api
   ```
   Check API docs on http://127.0.0.1:8001/docs.

### Authentication

We use our own IAM service for
authentication - [InNoHassle Accounts](https://github.com/one-zero-eight/InNoHassle-Accounts).
To authenticate the user, you need to pass the `Authorization` header with the `Bearer: <jwt_token>`.
How to get token:

1. First of all, go to [innohassle.ru](https://innohassle.ru) and log in if you are not logged in (or register). That
   will add cookie with
   account secret needed for the next step.
2. Go to [Accounts](https://api.innohassle.ru/accounts/v0/docs#/Tokens/tokens_generate_my_token) API and execute the
   the method `GET /tokens/generate-my-token`, copy the token from the response.
3. Go to the Swagger of API you want to authenticate and click on the `Authorize` button in the top right corner, paste
   the token
   in the `Value` field and click `Authorize`. Now you can use protected endpoints from the Swagger.

### Testing

For testing we use ```pytest```.
* To run tests enter in your terminal:
   ```
   uv run pytest tests
   ```
* To generate test coverage report run:
   ```
   uv run pytest  --cov-config=.coveragerc --cov=src/ tests/
   ```
   You can change coverage ignored folders/files in `.coveragerc`.
* To run evaluation script:
   ```
   uv run --script scripts/search_result_metrics.py
   ```

### Deployment

We use Docker with Docker Compose plugin to run the website on servers.

1. Copy the file with environment variables: `cp .env.example .env`
2. Change environment variables in the `.env` file
3. Copy the file with settings: `cp settings.example.yaml settings.yaml`
4. Change settings in the `settings.yaml` file according to your needs
   (check [settings.schema.yaml](../InNoHassle-Search/settings.schema.yaml) for more info)
5. Install Docker with Docker Compose
6. Build a Docker image: `docker compose build --pull`
7. Run the container: `docker compose up --detach`
8. Check the logs: `docker compose logs -f`
